# How it works

Magnetissimo has different torrent site indexers that run on GenServer. Each
will process a site asynchronously and save the torrents it's find in the
database.

Visit the home page and you'll see a paginated collection of torrents you can
use.

**There is no configuration needed**.

It'll just do it's thing and serve up torrents so fast your hard drive will
explode.
